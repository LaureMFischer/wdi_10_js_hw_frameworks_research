# Client-Side Framework Research

We've learned about **Angular.js**, one of the most popular client-side frameworks available today. It's not the only one, though &ndash; the framework landscape is pretty crowded right now, with no clear "winner".

**Your assignment** is to research a JavaScript framework other than Angular, and present your findings in a few paragraphs. Your fellow students are your audience; try to answer any questions they might have if they were deciding on a framewor to use for a project. How is your chosen framework similar to Angular? How is it different? What kind of templates does it use? Are there any options to easily integrate it with Rails? Are there any notable apps built with it?

Submit your report in a pull request as a plain-text or Markdown file. Include links to any web sites you found useful in your search. Before submitting, use `Command+Option+Q` to hard-wrap each of your paragraphs at 80 characters.
